# Security Policy

## Supported versions

While all known vulnerabilities in the Semgr8s application are listed below and we intent to fix vulnerabilities as soon as we become aware, both, Python and OS packages of the Semgr8s image may become vulnerable over time and we suggest to frequently update to the latest version or rebuilding the image from source yourself.
At present, we only support the latest version.
We stick to semantic versioning, so unless the major version changes, updating Semgr8s should never break your installation.

## Known vulnerabilities

Known vulnerabilities are published after resolution under [GitHub Security](https://github.com/semgr8ns/semgr8s/security).

## Reporting a vulnerability

We are very grateful for reports on vulnerabilities discovered in the project, specifically as it is intended to increase security for the community.
We aim to investigate and fix these as soon as possible. Please submit vulnerabilities via [GitHub Vulnerability Reporting](https://github.com/semgr8ns/semgr8s/security/advisories/new).
